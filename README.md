# EvilBot ü§ñ (Discontinued)

**EvilBot** was a lightweight, customizable Discord bot built in Java with a focus on simplicity and plugin extensibility. While development on EvilBot has been discontinued in favor of [QuoteVault](https://quotevault.org), it still serves as a strong foundation for command-based bots and plugin systems.

## üß± Plugin Development

Creating a plugin for EvilBot is simple and modular. Each plugin follows a defined structure, allowing you to:

- Register your own commands
- Handle Discord events
- Maintain isolated configurations and data

### üî® Basic Plugin Example

```java
public class Plugin implements EvilBotPlugin {

    @Override
    public String pluginName() {
        return "Plugin Name";
    }

    @Override
    public String pluginVersion() {
        return "1.0";
    }

    @Override
    public String pluginAuthor() {
        return "SynicallyEvil";
    }

    @Override
    public void onLoad() {
      System.out.println("Hello World.");
      EvilBotAPI api = EvilBot.getBot().getApi();
      // Add command: api.addCommand(new CustomCommand()); It must implement Command.
      // Add listener: api.addListener(new CustomListener()); It must extend JDA's ListenerAdapter.
    }
}
```

### Requirements

- Java 17+
- Maven or a Java IDE that supports Maven
